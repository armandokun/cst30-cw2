## Coursework Requirements: 

1. You create a website that displays numerical data, predictions about the numerical data and the results of
sentiment analysis.
2. The numerical data will be obtained from web services. It cannot be obtained from web scraping. For
example, it could be product price data from web services, stock prices, exchange rate prices, weather,
football results, etc.
3. The text data for sentiment analysis will be obtained from web services, such as the Twitter API or Facebook
Graph.
4. Machine learning will be used to make predictions about future values of the data.
5. You will also display synthetic data that we will provide to check your data visualization and machine
learning.
6. All third party data will be stored in the cloud.
7. The front end of the website only has to display visualizations of the data, predictions about the data and the
results of the sentiment analysis. No other functionality is required.
8. The code that downloads data from web services and uploads it to the cloud must be written in TypeScript.
9. Your website will be hosted on the cloud using serverless technology. Lambda functions on the server can be
written in any programming language (JavaScript is recommended).
10. The front end of your website can use ordinary JavaScript or a JavaScript framework.
11. WebSockets will push new data items to subscribed clients.
12. The coursework and teaching materials will be based on Amazon Web Services (AWS). You are welcome to
use a different cloud provider. However, we will only be able to provide very limited support with projects
that are based on a different cloud provider.

## Deliverables: 
  Proposal document. This must contain:
    A. Brief description of the proposed website.
    B. Mock-ups of front end of website showing proposed data visualization. These can be pen and paper,
Word, Inkscape etc.
    C. List of source(s) of numerical data.
    D. List of source(s) of data for sentiment analysis.
    E. Screenshot and URL of static website hosted on cloud.
